  ## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  ##
  ## Project the input data ``X`` of shape [Observations, Features] into a new coordinate system
  ## where axes (principal components) are in descending order of explained variance of the original ``X`` data
  ## i.e. the first axis explains most of the variance.
  ##
  ## The rotated ``components`` cmatrix can be used to project new observations onto the same base:
  ##   X' * loadings, with X' of shape [Observations', Features].
  ##   X' must be mean centered
  ## Its transposed can be use to reconstruct the original X:
  ##   X ~= projected * components.transpose()
  ##
  ## PCA requires:
  ##   - mean-centered features. This procedure does the centering by default.
  ##     You can pass "center = false", if your preprocessing leads to centering.
  ##   - Features of the same scale/amplitude. Some alternatives include
  ##     min-max scaling, mean normalization, standardization (mean = 0 and unit variance),
  ##     rescaling column to unit-length.
  ##
  ## Note: PCA without centering is also called truncated SVD,
  ##       which is useful when centering is costly, for example
  ##       in the case of sparse matrices from parsing text.
  ##
  ## Inputs:
  ##   - A matrix of shape [Nb of observations, Nb of features]
  ##   - The number of components to keep (default 2D for 2D projection)
  ##
  ## Returns:
  ##   - A tuple of PCA projected matrix and principal components matrix:
  ##     projected: a matrix of shape [Nb of observations, Nb of components] in descending order of explained variance
  ##     components: a matrix of shape [Nb of features, Nb of components] to project new data on the same orthogonal basis
  assert X.rank == 2, "Input should be a 2-dimensional matrix"
