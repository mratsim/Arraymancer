  # See : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39095993/does-each-floating-point-operation-take-the-same-time
  # and https://www.agner.org/optimize/vectorclass.pdf "Using multiple accumulators"
  #
  # FP addition has a latency of 3~5 clock cycles, i.e. the result cannot be reused for that much time.
  # But the throughput is 1 FP add per clock cycle (and even 2 per clock cycle for Skylake)
  # So we need to use extra accumulators to fully utilize the FP throughput despite FP latency.
  # On Skylake, all FP latencies are 4: https://www.agner.org/optimize/blog/read.php?i=415
  #
  # Note that this is per CPU cores, each core needs its own "global CPU accumulator" to combat
  # false sharing when multithreading.
  #
  # This wouldn't be needed with fast-math because compiler would consider FP addition associative
  # and create intermediate variables as needed to exploit this through put.
