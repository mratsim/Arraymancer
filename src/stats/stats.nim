proc covariance_matrix*[T: SomeFloat](x, y: Tensor[T]): Tensor[T] =

  ## Input:
  ##   - 2 tensors of shape [Nb observations, features]
  ##     Note: contrary to Numpy default each row is an observations while
  ##           echo column represent a feature/variable observed.
  ## Returns:
  ##   - The unbiased covariance (normalized by the number of observations - 1)
  ##     in the shape [features, features]

  # The covariance is cov(X, Y) = 1/(n-1) * ∑i->n (Xi - X.mean)(Yi - Y.mean)
  # The covariance matrix is generalizing this for all Xi and Yi of both matrices:
