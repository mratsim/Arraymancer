Tutorial: Aggregate and statistics
==================================

``sum`` and ``mean`` functions are available to compute the sum and mean
of a tensor. ``sum`` and ``mean`` can also be computed along an axis
with the ``axis`` argument.

Generic aggregates on the whole tensor or along an axis can be computed
with ``agg`` and ``agg_inplace`` functions.
