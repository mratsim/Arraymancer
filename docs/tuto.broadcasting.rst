Tutorial: Broadcasting
==============================

Arraymancer supports explicit broadcasting with ``broadcast`` and its
alias ``bc``. And supports implicit broadcasting with operations
beginning with a dot:

.. code:: nim

    let j = [0, 10, 20, 30].toTensor(Cpu).reshape(4,1)
    let k = [0, 1, 2].toTensor(Cpu).reshape(1,3)

    echo j .+ k
    # Tensor of shape 4x3 of type "int" on backend "Cpu"
    # |0      1       2|
    # |10     11      12|
    # |20     21      22|
    # |30     31      32|

-  ``.+``,\ ``.-``,
-  ``.*``: broadcasted element-wise matrix multiplication also called
   Hadamard product)
-  ``./``: broadcasted element-wise division or integer-division
-  ``.+=``, ``.-=``, ``.*=``, ``./=``: in-place versions. Only the right
   operand is broadcastable.
