  CpuStorage*[T] = ref object
    ## This implements a opaque refcounted storage for copy-on-write.
    ## Data is shared between multiple tensors as long as none modifies the data.
    ## If a mutation is needed, it is done in-place if the Tensor is the only one referring to this storage.
    ## Otherwise the mutator copies the data and refers to his own copy.
    ##
    ## Note: Do not use the exposed Fdata, this is only exposed for transition.
    Frefcount: int
    Fdata*: seq[T] # This should only be visible internally

  CudaSeq* [T: SomeReal] = object
    ## Seq-like structure on the Cuda backend.
    ##
    ## Nim garbage collector will automatically ask cuda to clear GPU memory if ``data`` becomes unused.
    ##
    ## Warning ⚠: This will be revamped, renamed and kept private before 0.3.0 for copy-on-write semantics on Cuda.
    len*: int
    data*: ref[ptr UncheckedArray[T]]

  # Note, non-CPU storage are also forward-declared here so that AnyTensor
  # is always Tensor + CudaTensor + ...
  # The implementation requires cudaMalloc / cudaFree and cannot be done in this file
  # as it is also imported on for non-Cuda targets.
