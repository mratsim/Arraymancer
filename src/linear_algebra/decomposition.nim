  ## Compute the eigenvalues and eigen vectors of a symmetric matrix
  ## Input:
  ##   - A symmetric matrix of shape [n, n]
  ##   - A boolean: true if you also want the eigenvectors, false otherwise
  ##   - A slice of the rankings of eigenvalues you request. For example requesting
  ##     eigenvalues 2 and 3 would be done with 1..2.
  ## Returns:
  ##   - A tuple with:

  ##     - The corresponding eigenvector if it was requested. (shape [n, m])
