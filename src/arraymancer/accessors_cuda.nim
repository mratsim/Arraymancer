# For element-wise operations, instead of a sequential iterator like for CPU,
# it will be faster to have many threads compute the index -> offset and update
# the data at this offset.
#
# For this we need:
#   - to store strides and offset on the cuda device to avoid copies
#   - a way to convert element #10 of the tensor to the real offset (column major),
#     the kernels won't use tensor[2,5] as an index
