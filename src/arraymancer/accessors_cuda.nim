# For element-wise operations, instead of a sequential iterator like for CPU,
# it will be faster to have many threads compute the index -> offset and update
# the data at this offset.
#
# For this we need:
#   - to store strides and offset on the cuda device to avoid copies
#   - a way to convert element #10 of the tensor to the real offset (column major),
#     the kernels won't use tensor[2,5] as an index

  ## Convert "Give me element 10" to the real index/memory offset.
  ## Reference Nim CPU version
  ## This is not meant to be used on serial architecture due to the division overhead.
  ## On GPU however it will allow threads to address the real memory addresses independantly.
