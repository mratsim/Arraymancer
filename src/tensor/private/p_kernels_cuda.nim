# Design: due to limitations and difficulties in C++
# (no mutable iterators, stack hidden from GC, exception issue, casting workaround for builtin_assume_aligned)
# I choose to sacrifice readability here to avoid a plethora of "when not defined(cpp) in the codebase.
# This file will serve as a bridge between Cuda C++ and Nim C.

# Explanation:
#
# - To avoid creating a proc AST from scratch: we create a dummy proc.
# - pass it to an overloading template (cuda_genkernel_assign for in-place/assignments)
# - overloading template creates the cuda code, the import and a Nim wrapper
# - Unfortunately the Nim wrapper cannot be called as-is in other file as it uses C++ semantics
# - So we compile this file first to C++, rename it to .cu and tell nvcc to use the new .cu file

# Important: this file will be compiled to C++, only primitive types like pointers and float should be used,
# other here be dragons during linking with C code.
