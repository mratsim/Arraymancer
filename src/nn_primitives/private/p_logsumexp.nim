# Implements numerically stable logsumexp

# - Classic version: log ∑i exp(xi) = α + log ∑i exp(xi−α)
# with α = max(xi) for xi in x

# - Streaming version: from http://www.nowozin.net/sebastian/blog/streaming-log-sum-exp-computation.html
# which is similar to Welford algorithm for streaming mean and variance in statistics

# Benchmark shows that the streaming version is 25% faster
# from batches of 256x3 classes to 256x1000 classes
# (see project_root/benchmark_implementation)

  #  - Only one loop over the data
