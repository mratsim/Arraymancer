proc broadcast2*[T](a, b: ClTensor[T]): tuple[a, b: ClTensor[T]] {.noSideEffect, noinit.}=
  ## Broadcast 2 tensors so they have compatible shapes for element-wise computations.
  ##
  ## Tensors in the tuple can be accessed with output.a and output.b
  ##
  ## The returned broadcasted Tensors share the underlying data with the input.
  ##
  ## Dimension(s) of size 1 can be expanded to arbitrary size by replicating
  ## values along that dimension.
  ##
  ## Warning âš :
  ##   This is a no-copy operation, data is shared with the input.
  ##   This proc does not guarantee that a ``let`` value is immutable.
  ##   A broadcasted tensor should not be modified and only used for computation.
