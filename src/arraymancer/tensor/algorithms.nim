  ## Do not get confused by the `isSorted` argument which is not used to sort

  ## is already sorted.
  ##
  ## There is another version of this procedure which gets an `order` argument
  ## that let's you sort the output (in ascending or descending order).
  ##
  ## Inputs:
  ##   - t: The input Tensor
  ##   - isSorted: Set this to `true` if the input tensor is already sorted,

  ##
  ## Result:
  ##   - A new Tensor with the unique elements of the input Tensor in the order
  ##     in which they first appear on the input Tensor.

  ##
  ## Result:
  ##   - A rank-1 Tensor containing the (unsorted) union of the two input Tensors.
  ##
  ## Notes:
  ##   - The equivalent `numpy` function is called `union1d`, while the
  ##     equivalent `Matlab` function is called `union`. However, both of
  ##     those functions always sort the output. To replicate the same
  ##     behavior, simply apply `sort` to the output of this function.
  ##
  ## Example:
  ## ```nim

  ## let t2 = [4, 2, 2, 3].toTensor
  ## echo union(t1, t2)

  ##
  ## Result:
  ##   - An unsorted rank-1 Tensor containing the intersection of
  ##     the input Tensors.
  ##
  ## Note:
  ##   - The equivalent `numpy` function is called `intersect1d`, while the
  ##     equivalent `Matlab` function is called `intersect`. However, both of
  ##     those functions always sort the output. To replicate the same
  ##     behavior, simply apply `sort` to the output of this function.
  ##
  ## Example:
  ## ```nim
  ## let t1 = arange(0, 5)
  ## let t2 = arange(3, 8)
  ##
  ## echo intersection(t1, t2)

  ## `t1` that are ``not`` found in `t2`.
  ##
  ## If `symmetric` is true, the "symmetric" difference of the Tensors is
  ## returned instead, i.e. the elements which are either not in `t1` ``or``
  ## not in `t2`.
  ##
  ## Inputs:
  ##   - t1, t2: Input Tensors.
  ##   - symmetric: Whether to return a symmetric or non symmetric difference.
  ##                Defaults to `false`.
  ##
  ## Result:
  ##   - An unsorted rank-1 Tensor containing the selected "difference" between
  ##     the input Tensors.
  ##
  ## Note:
  ##   - The equivalent `numpy` function is called `setdiff1d`, while the
  ##     equivalent `Matlab` function is called `setdiff`. However, both of
  ##     those functions always sort the output. To replicate the same
  ##     behavior, simply apply `sort` to the output of this function.
  ##
  ## Examples:
  ## ```nim
  ## let t1 = arange(0, 5)
  ## let t2 = arange(3, 8)
  ##
  ## echo setDiff(t1, t2)
  ## # Tensor[system.int] of shape "[3]" on backend "Cpu"
  ## #     2     1     0
  ##
  ## echo setDiff(t1, t2, symmetric = true)

proc contains*[T](t: Tensor[T], item: T): bool {.inline.}=
  ## Returns true if `item` is in the input Tensor `t` or false if not found.
  ## This is a shortcut for `find(t, item) >= 0`.
  ##
  ## This allows the `in` and `notin` operators, i.e.:
  ## `t.contains(item)` is the same as `item in a`.
  ##
  ## Examples:
  ## ```nim
  ## var t = [1, 3, 5].toTensor
  ## assert t.contains(5)
  ## assert 3 in t
  ## assert 99 notin t
  ## ```
  return find(t, item) >= 0

proc ismember*[T](t1, t2: Tensor[T]): Tensor[bool] {.noinit.} =
  ## Element-wise check whether elements of a Tensor are contained in another Tensor
  ##
  ## Inputs:
  ##   - t1: Tensor whose elements will be looked for, one by one, in `t2`
  ##   - t2: Tensor in which elements of `t1` will be looked for
  ##
  ## Result:
  ##   - A boolean tensor of the same shape as `t1`.
  ##     Each element indicates if `t2` contains the `t1` element that
  ##     is found in that particular position.
  ##
  ## Example:
  ## ```nim
  ## let t1 = arange(6).reshape(2, 3)
  ## let t2 = [-3, 0, 2, 5].toTensor
  ##
  ## echo t1.ismember(t2)
  ## # Tensor[system.bool] of shape "[2, 3]" on backend "Cpu"
  ## # |true     false     true|
  ## # |false    false     true|
  ## ```
